            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <p>Temple Inn and Suites have multiple gorgeous
                locations and set-ups for a reception. The main attraction
                of most weddings held is a large, 80 x 64 ballroom that
                can seat up to 300 guests with room to spare for a 
                dance floor and any fun acitivites desired. These ballrooms
                are also accompanied by large windows that allow the guests
                to see across a beautiful landscape. If you wish for something
                smaller, we have plenty of medium-sized rooms or, possibly, a 
                large outdoor set up with a canopy, tables, and room for 
                activites.
