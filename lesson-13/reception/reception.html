        <h2>Accommodations</h2>
        <p>Temple Inn and Suites are host to very beautiful and afforable

            for food, decorations, and setup for just-married couples
            and their families attending.

            <p>The Bear River Massacre occurred in 1863 at a point a few miles 
                northwest of Preston. The Bear River Massacre Site is a National
                Historic Landmark. In 1866, Latter-day Saint (LDS, or Mormon) 
                pioneers arrived in the northern end of the Cache Valley, 
                stretching across southeastern Idaho and northeastern Utah. 
                They founded a community in that location and named it Worm Creek,
                but in 1881 changed it to Preston because leaders of the LDS Church
                in Salt Lake City objected to the name "Worm Creek" being 
                part of any church congregation's name. The name 
                Preston was suggested by a local member to honor 
                William B. Preston, who at the time was president of 
                the LDS Church's Cache Stake.
                It was not until the 1880s while William
                C. Parkinson was serving as the bishop 
                of the Preston LDS Ward that a regular 
                townsite was laid out.
