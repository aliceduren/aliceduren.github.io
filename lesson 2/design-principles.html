            <h2>HIERARCHY</h2>

            <p>Unsplash is a great place for getting stock images and
                other useful photos, but the way the first page is displayed
                in mobile shows a great example of hierarchy in web design.
                The firsts thing our eyes are drawn to are the bold "wallpapers"
                heading at the top, followed by the description and options
                for what kind of wallpaper shots there are. Due to our eyes
                naturally scrolling down the page, this resembles a classic
                use of hierarchy in typography for a webpage.

            <h2>RULE OF THIRDS</h2>
            <h3>Amazon</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ref=nav_logo">https://www.amazon.com<br>/ref=nav_logo</a>
            <img src="RO3.jpg" alt="Screenshot taken from amazon.com to show rule of thirds.">
            <p>Though the rule of thirds is a common principle of design, it can
                be hard to spot. In Amazon's case, the first place to notice it is on the 
                home page, specifically in the recommended tabs. The way the pictures
                are spread is a rule of thirds layout, with the three pictures
                in the three columns that are seen in a rule of thirds grid. This is
                not only good design, but a great way to get the viewer browsing the
                site with familiar options already listed there.

            <h2>AlLIGNMENT</h2>
            <h3>Pinterest</h3>

            <img src="Ali.jpg" alt="Screenshot taken from pinterest.com to show alignment.">
            <p>Alignment is a very useful principle to show in design, and a
                great place it's shown is on the website Pinterest. This website is all about
                showcasing beautiful images and stunning photographs, and a
                great way to show that is through alignment. On mobile, the way
                the photos are aligned in columns and, despite changes in a photo's
                dimensions, maintains an aligned format and makes it a very clean
                and organzied browsing experience.
